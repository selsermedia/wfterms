                <li><strong>Roles.</strong> For the purposes of this Agreement, Webflow is acting as a “service provider” to you, and you are a “customer” of the Service, regardless of whether you pay fees to obtain the Service. Any natural persons accessing or using your User Content are deemed your “<strong>End Users</strong>.” You agree that Webflow does not have a direct relationship with any of your End Users and Webflow is not responsible for how you process or otherwise handle any End User information. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for (1) providing any required notices and (2) obtaining all End User consents required under applicable data protection and marketing laws.</li>
                <li><strong>Applicable laws.</strong> You may have additional obligations under local law other than those described in these Terms, particularly if you or your End Users are located outside of the United States. Such obligations may be more restrictive than these Terms. Use of the Service does not ensure compliance with such laws, nor is Webflow responsible for your compliance with such laws.&nbsp;</li>
                <li><strong>Security safeguards. </strong>You will use all reasonable efforts to protect information collected from End Users via your use of the Service, including any personal information obtained from unauthorized access or use of your Account. You are solely responsible for configuring and implementing security controls to properly manage and secure your website cookies, website headers, DNS configurations, and subdomains, as well all similarly related web attributes. In the event you discover that any End User information collected by you has been breached, compromised, or inadvertently exposed to non-authorized third parties, you shall notify Webflow promptly of such a breach or exposure including the root cause, remediation steps, and compensating controls to ensure such a breach does not occur in the future.</li>
                <li><strong>Security notification.</strong> You are responsible for providing any applicable notices to your End Users, third parties, or authorities under any applicable data breach notification statutes and related laws. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for any losses, personal injury, or property damage to End Users arising from or relating to your use of the Service.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy.</strong> As set forth above, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for providing any required notices and obtaining all required consents from End Users in connection with your use of the Service. Your notice and consent must be compliant with all applicable data protection and security laws and regulations. Without limiting the foregoing, before collecting or using any End User information, you must provide adequate notice of the End User information you collect, how it will be used and/or shared, and obtain any necessary consents required under the applicable data protection laws and regulations. You agree to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations (including those applying to personal information) in connection with your access and use of the Services. You will respond to any End Users wishing to exercise their privacy rights, under the applicable law, as it relates to any information collected via your use of the Services. For example, if End Users located in certain jurisdictions may exercise a “right to be forgotten” (or “erasure”) to the information you have collected about them, you shall comply with their request as required by applicable law. For clarity, you (or, the “data controller”) are directly responsible for the End User information you instruct Webflow to process when you use the Service, including any information you instruct a third-party application (made available via the Service), to process. Webflow is not a data controller of End User&nbsp; information and is not responsible for responding to End Users on your behalf. To the extent Webflow receives a request from an End User or authority about your use of the Service, Webflow will notify you in compliance with or as permitted by law. To the extent that Webflow processes personal information of your End Users, Webflow does so as a “data processor” or “service provider” under applicable data protection law. If applicable, Webflow shall process your End Users’ personal information in accordance with our <a href="https://webflow.com/legal/dpa">Data Processing Addendum</a>, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</li>

              <p><strong>5.1 Third-Party Services</strong></p>
              <p>The Service may integrate with various third party services and applications (collectively, “<strong>Third-Party Services</strong>”) that may make their content, products, or services available to you. Examples of Third-Party Services include certain domain name registration services, social media platforms, E-Commerce Payment Processors (as defined below), and other integrations or extensions, stock images and email service subscriptions for sale via the Service and other integration partners and service providers. These Third-Party Services may have their own terms and policies, and your use of them will be governed by those terms and policies. Any information that a Third-Party Service collects, stores and processes from you or your Account will be subject to such Third-Party Service’s terms of service, privacy notice, or similar terms, and will not be subject to our Privacy Policy or Data Processing Addendum. Therefore, please evaluate and ensure you trust each Third-Party Service prior to connecting Your Site to its services. Each Third-Party Service is solely responsible for providing all support, maintenance and technical assistance to you with respect to their services (including their interoperation with your Account and User Content). When using Third-Party Services, your security is your responsibility. We don't control Third-Party Services, and we’re not liable for Third-Party Services or for any transaction you may enter into with them, or for what they do. We may receive a revenue share from Third-Party Services that we recommend to you or that you otherwise engage via the Service. You agree that we may, at any time and in our sole discretion, and without any notice to you, suspend, disable access to, or remove any Third-Party Services and Webflow shall not be liable for any losses, damages, or liabilities stemming from such suspension, disabling or removal, including without limitation for any loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill or other intangible losses, or business disruption, costs or expenses you may incur or otherwise experience as a result (except where prohibited by applicable law).</p>

              <p>For the avoidance of doubt, we have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the User Content published to or made available through the Service by our users or anyone else.

However, we reserve the right, at any time and in our sole discretion, and without notice to you, to determine the rightful Account or site owner and to transfer an Account or site to such owner. Our decision in that respect is final. If we feel that we can’t reasonably determine the rightful owner, we reserve the right to suspend or disable an Account and its related User Content until the disputing parties reach a resolution. We also may request documentation to help determine the rightful owner, including but not limited to a government-issued photo ID, credit card invoice, or business license.</p>

              <h2>8. Billing and Payment<br></h2>
              <p>Users of the Service may be required to provide their credit card details to Webflow or the payment service provider retained by Webflow (the “<strong>PSP</strong>”). Users will be responsible for paying all applicable fees related to their use of the Service (the “<strong>Fees</strong>”). You are solely responsible for all federal, state, and local taxes, including sales, use, VAT, or similar transaction taxes imposed on your paid subscription to the Service, unless you provide Webflow with a valid tax exemption certificate (“<strong>Taxes</strong>”). All Taxes payable by you will be separately stated and exclusive of the Fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will have no liability for taxes that are statutorily imposed on Webflow, including taxes or fees based on Webflow’s net or gross income.</p>
              <p>All paid plans must enter a valid payment account. Free accounts are not required to provide payment account information. We will immediately bill you upon any upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.</p>
              <p>For monthly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account.</p>
              <p>For annual payment plans, the Service is billed up front for one (1) year subscription periods and is non-refundable. Your annual plan will automatically renew for successive one (1) year subscription periods, and you will be charged the applicable Fees on each annual anniversary of your purchase, unless you cancel your Account plan prior to the end of the then-current annual term. There will be no refunds or credits for partial terms of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for unused terms with an open account.</p>
              <p>Certain credits may apply when you purchase an upgrade to the Service or switch from a monthly plan to an annual payment plan.</p>
              <p>To the extent your use of the Service exceeds the usage limits provided for in your payment plan (as set forth on <a href="https://webflow.com/pricing">https://webflow.com/pricing</a>, and including but not limited to the usage categories of monthly visits, CDN bandwidth and API requests per minute), Webflow reserves the right to charge you overage fees for any such excessive use, in Webflow’s sole discretion.</p>
              <p>We reserve the right to change our fees and to institute new charges at any time (including, for clarity, for any renewal), upon notice to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Webflow in our sole discretion. Your use of the Service following such notification constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased fees.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>The Service includes features that enable you at your discretion to provide or sell products and services to, or otherwise collect payments from, your End Users (such activities, “ <strong>E-Commerce Activities</strong>”). In order to conduct E-Commerce Activities, you must be 18 years or older or at least the age of majority in your country of residence and you must provide your full legal name, current address, valid email address, and any other information we request. In the event of a dispute regarding account ownership, we reserve the right to request documentation to determine or confirm account ownership.</p>
              <p>We are not a party to, and we are not liable for, your E-Commerce Activities. You are solely responsible for your E-Commerce Activities, and compliance with any laws or regulations related to them, including without limitation the following:</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>You are solely responsible for: (a) all Taxes and fees associated with your E-Commerce Activities, including without limitation any Taxes related to the purchase or sale of products or services in connection with your E-Commerce Activities; (b) collecting, reporting and remitting required Taxes to relevant government authorities; (c) informing your End Users of required Taxes, and providing them with invoices as required by applicable law; (d) monitoring distance sales thresholds in the European Union (“<strong>EU</strong>”) and other indirect Taxes (such as value-added tax or goods and services tax) and registration thresholds in the countries where you have customers or where you ship goods or provide services; and (e) registering for indirect Taxes in countries where you are required to register. You also agree that any tax estimates, reporting or related materials that we may provide via the Service are for illustration purposes only, and you may not rely on them to comply with your tax obligations.

                <li>You are solely responsible for fulfilling and delivering your products and services to your End Users as part of your E-Commerce Activities.</li>
                <li>You are solely responsible for any claims or warranties you make in connection with your E-Commerce Activities and any claims made by End Users against you.</li>
                <li>You are solely responsible for handling any comments or complaints related to your E-Commerce Activities, including without limitation any issues related to payments, promotions, refunds or chargebacks. You agree to provide accurate and complete contact information on your sites so that your End Users can submit comments or questions to you.</li>
                <li>You agree to post and make clearly available on your sites a privacy and cookie policy, and any other terms or policies that: (i) complies with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, (ii) is conspicuously displayed to all End Users, and (iii) clearly and accurately describes to End Users what information you collect (such as login information, contact form data, cookies, etc.) and how you use and share such information (including for marketing and advertising) with Webflow and other third parties. You agree that we do not and will not provide any legal advice regarding such terms, policies or compliance. Without limiting any other term of the Agreement, you represent and warrant that your E-Commerce Activities will comply with all applicable laws and regulations.</li>
                <li>You must comply with all applicable laws regarding the transmission of data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside. If you use the Service outside the United States, you are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, including without limitation, rules regarding acceptable online conduct, data privacy, and export and import regulations of other countries.</li>
                <li>For the avoidance of doubt, any User Content that a user offers for sale through the Service is the seller's sole responsibility, so you must look solely to the seller for any damages that result from your purchase or use of User Content. We are not a party to, and will have no responsibility or liability for, any communications, transactions, interactions, or disputes between you and the provider of any User Content.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>To accept payments from your End Users in connection with your E-Commerce Activities, you must create and connect your Webflow account to your <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> account (the “<strong>E-Commerce Payment Processor</strong>”). Your relationship and account with the E-Commerce Payment Processor is governed by the E-Commerce Payment Processor’s policies, terms, and conditions you must agree to. By registering with the E-Commerce Payment Processor, you agree that you will not accept or process any payments related to your E-Commerce Activities under the Service that are connected with any <a href="https://stripe.com/us/restricted-businesses">prohibited businesses, business activities or business practices</a>, which may vary from country to country.

The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). If your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, Webflow will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Webflow may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
              <p>17.3 EXCEPTIONS TO ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in a federal or state court located within the Central District of California with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights.</p>
              <p>17.4 WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. You and Webflow agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between Webflow and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND Webflow ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Webflow otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” Section will be deemed null and void.</p>
              <p>17.5 LOCATION OF ARBITRATION. Arbitration will take place in San Francisco, California. You and Webflow agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the California state and Federal courts located in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction and you and Webflow agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p>
